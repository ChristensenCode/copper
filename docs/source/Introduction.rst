Introduction
=============
Results from building energy simulations largely depend on how HVAC equipment are modeled. As they rarely operate at their full load and rated performance it is important that reasonable data is used to model an HVAC equipment's part load performance. **Copper** was created to allow building energy modelers, engineers, and researchers to generate simulation-ready performance curves of HVAC equipment that not only capture their typical behavior at part load but are also generated to match a set of design characteristics such as full load and part load efficiencies.

What can **Copper** do?
------------------------
* Generate sets of curves
* Plot curves
* Export curves

What HVAC equipment does **Copper** handle?
--------------------------------------------
* Chillers

Future developments
-------------------
* Support for packaged direct expansion
* Generation of ASHRAE Standard 205 compliant equipment performance maps
