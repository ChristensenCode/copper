Introduction
=============
`Copper` is a performance curve generator for building energy simulations. It uses a genetic algorithm to modify exisiting performance curves to match specific performance indicators at both full and part load.

What can `Copper` do?
----------------------
* Generate performance curves sets based on `typical` sets
* Modify existing performance curves from exisiting equipment
* Plot curves
* Export them to the `EnergyPlus` and `DOE-2` input formats
