Introduction
=============
`Copper` is a performance curve generator for building energy simulation. It uses a genetic algorithm to modify existing, or an aggregate of existing performance curves to match specific full and part load energy performance metric values.

What can `Copper` do?
----------------------
* Generate sets of curves
* Plot curves
* Export curves

What HVAC equipment does `Copper` handle?
-----------------------------------------
* Chillers
* Packaged direct expansion (*coming soon...*)
