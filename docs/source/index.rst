Documentation for **Copper**
==================================

**Version**: |version|

**Copper** is a building energy simulation performance curve generator for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment. It uses a genetic algorithm to modify existing or a set of aggregated existing performance curves to match specific design characteristics including full and part load energy performance metric values.

Copper generates performance curves that can be used in most common building energy software such as `EnergyPlus`_ or `DOE-2`_.

You might be interested in **Copper** if you are an energy modeler, engineer, or researcher wanting to generate simulation-ready performance curves that match a set of specific design efficiency and characteristics.
